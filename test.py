    ## SELECT BASE COLOR
    ## use color curve to add/remove saturation and brightness
    #### remove some brightness and saturation for 3 more colors, shift hue slightly down
    #### add some brightness and saturation for 3 more colors, shift hue slightly up
    ## add dimension by then  copying what we have and removing saturation while adding brightness and shifting hue slightly up
    ## add dimension by then  copying what we have and adding saturation while removing brightness and shifting hue slightly down

    ## allow for slight randomization so you can regen colour pallete
    ## allow tweaking of base hue
